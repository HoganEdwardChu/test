# Pinpoint Go Agent Configuration

## Config Option
The functions for setting up the Pinpoint Go Agent are as follows:

* WithAppName(name string)
    * Set the application name.
* WithAgentId(id string)
    * Set id to distinguish agent. We recommend that you enable hostname to be included.
    * If agent id is not set, automatically generated id is given.
* WithCollectorHost(host string)
    * Set the point collector address.
* WithLogLevel(level string)
    * Sets the level of log generated by the pinpoint agent. Either debug, info, warn, or error must be set, default is info.
* WithSamplingRate(rate int)
    * Sets the sampling rate. Sample 1/rate. In other words, if the rate is 1, then it will be 100% and if it is 100, it will be 1% sampling. The default is 1.
* WithConfigFile(filePath string)
    * The aforementioned settings can be saved to the config file in YAML format. The format of the YAML setup file is as follows:
      ```
      applicationname: "MyAppName"
      collector:
        host: "collector.myhost.com"
      logLevel: "error"
      sampling:
        rate: 10
      ```
